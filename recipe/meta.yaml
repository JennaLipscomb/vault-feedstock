  summary: A tool for managing secrets.
  description: |
    Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you
    want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates,
    and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing
    tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.
